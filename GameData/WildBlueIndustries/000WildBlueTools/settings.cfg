	// Each time the player prospects for resources, GoldStrike records the location and calculates the distance between the current location and the last prospected location.
	// In order for resources to be considered for selection as the resource that was found, the player must have traveled a minimum distance.
	// You can specify, in kilometers, the minProspectDistance that each resource requires between prospecting attempts.
	// Example: you might specify that Ore can only be added to the selection list if the distance traveled has been 3km, while Graviolium can be added to the selection list if the distance traveled has been 10km.
	// If minProspectDistance is NOT specified in the GOLDSTRIKE node, then we'll use a default value. That value is listed below.
